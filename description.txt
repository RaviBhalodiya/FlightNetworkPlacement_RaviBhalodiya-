Problem 1::

Here i have done this problem using  C. 
Here mystack is a[Max].
here i take one flag f initialized with 0.
then i check f=0 then insert the first element and make f=1.
Then i check previous element is 9 or not for checking 2nd condition.
If previously inserted element is 9 then next element should be 0.

otherwise i check previous element+1 is equal to the element which you want to 
insert as 1st condition,otherwise insertion is not possible.

Note:: According to your 2nd condition every pattern is possible.
i.e. 2 4 7 5 
for this pattern 
push 2 pop 2 push 4 pop 4 push 7 pop 7 push 5 pop 5




Problem 2::

Here i have done this problem using an array in C.

array a[]
n=numbers of kids
k=counting number


I have initialized n numbers of elements of array(kids) as 1 using for loop.

I have take two counter b and c which are initialized with 0

b is used for counting eliminated kids(set element to 0).

c is used for checking if n-1 elements are eliminated or not.

while loop is executed n-1 times  which means n-1 kids are eliminated. 

for loop is used for finding the winner.
